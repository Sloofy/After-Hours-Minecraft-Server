## What Modpack?
We have a custom modpack for our server that you will need to install. It leans into a Vanilla+ playstyle, offering better performance, greater visual fidelty, and new gameplay things to mess with. Does that sound vague? Yes. Yes it does.

## Download Instructions
1. Download [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) and log-in (This is the only launcher I'm supporting right now. I might support more launchers on the full modpack release).
2. Download the modpack file.
3. In MultiMC, go to the top-left corner of the main menu and click 'Add Instance' -> Import from zip -> Find the modpack file
4. Run the modpack. If there are any errors, click continue.

If you do not have Java 17 installed, you may get it [here for free](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu17.30.15-ca-jdk17.0.1-win_x64.msi). This is required for Minecraft 1.18 and above.

**As of December 15th, 2021, the modpack is not playable while we wait for other mod components to update to 1.18.1.**

## Contributing
This modpack uses [Packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz) to compile all the mods together. If the modpack needs to be updated, you can run the ./gitupdate.sh script (however, this should not be necessary). You may suggest other mods anywhere. Otherwise, you should probably refer to the [Packwiz documentation](https://packwiz.infra.link/) for further precise reading and how to use the tool.
